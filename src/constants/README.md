Network Configurations

NETWORKS: An array of network configurations, each including:

chainId: Identifier for the blockchain network.

fundManagerAddress: Address of the fund manager contract on the network.

fiberRouterAddress: Address of the fiber router contract on the network.

foundaryTokenAddress: Address of the Foundary token contract on the network.

Utility Functions

getSecurityKey(): Generates a security key based on environment variables.

getPrivateKey(): Decrypts and retrieves the private key from environment variables using the security key.

createAuthTokenForMultiswapBackend(): Generates an encrypted authentication token for the multiswap backend. It includes a time frame and a random key for security.

encrypt(data, key): Encrypts data using AES encryption with a given key.

decrypt(data, key): Decrypts data encrypted with AES using the given key.

getThreshold(threshold): Calculates a new threshold value by doubling the input threshold.

getExpiry(): Computes the expiry time set to one week from the current moment in Unix timestamp.

setRpcNodesData(data): Stores the provided RPC nodes data.

getRpcNodesData(): Retrieves the stored RPC nodes data.

Security and Data Handling

This file incorporates critical functionality for security, such as encryption and decryption of sensitive data, and generation of authentication tokens. The usage of environment variables suggests a design that keeps sensitive information out of the codebase, which is a best practice for security.

# IERC20
Overview

The IERC20.json file defines the interface for a standard ERC20 token, adhering to the Ethereum token standard specification. This interface includes essential functionalities for token transactions, including transfers, approvals, and balance checks.

# FiberRouter.json
Overview

The FiberRouter.json file from the ferrumnet/multiswap-validator-node repository contains a JSON object representing a smart contract interface for a "Fiber Router." This interface is likely used to interact with blockchain networks, facilitating operations such as swapping, liquidity provision, or routing transactions across different platforms.

Interface Details

Contract Name: The JSON is an interface for a contract named FiberRouter.

Compiler Version: The interface was compiled with Solidity version 0.8.0.

Optimization Enabled: Yes, with 200 runs.

EVM Version: The target EVM version for this contract is specified as Default.

Methods

1. swapExactTokensForTokens

Type: Function

Inputs:

amountIn: The amount of input tokens to swap.

amountOutMin: The minimum amount of output tokens that must be received for the transaction not to revert.

path: An array of token addresses used to determine the swap route.

to: The address to send the output tokens to.

deadline: A timestamp by which the transaction must be completed, or it will revert.

Outputs:

Array: Returns an array of numbers indicating the amounts of tokens received for each swap in the path.

State Mutability: Nonpayable

Details: This method facilitates a token swap operation, ensuring that the number of output tokens received is at least the amountOutMin specified, following the swap path provided.

2. swapTokensForExactTokens

Type: Function

Inputs:

amountOut: The exact amount of output tokens to receive.

amountInMax: The maximum amount of input tokens that can be swapped.

path: The route of token addresses for the swap.

to: The recipient address for the output tokens.

deadline: The transaction deadline.

Outputs:

Array: Outputs the amounts of tokens spent for each swap in the path.

State Mutability: Nonpayable

Details: Allows users to specify the exact amount of tokens they want to receive, the method calculates and limits the input to amountInMax.

Events

1. Swap

Inputs:

sender: The address initiating the swap.

amountIn: The amount of input tokens provided for the swap.

amountOut: The amount of output tokens received from the swap.

tokenIn: The address of the input token.

tokenOut: The address of the output token.

to: The recipient address.

Details: This event is emitted after a successful swap operation, detailing the swap amounts and the addresses involved.

Conclusion

The FiberRouter.json file defines an interface for a contract facilitating token swaps on a blockchain network, providing methods for exact or minimum token swaps along specified paths. It also includes an event to log swap operations. This documentation should assist auditors in understanding the contract's functionalities and intended behaviors.
