# app.ts

Here's the detailed documentation for each function in the `app.ts` file of the specified GitHub repository:

### Function: `responseAppender`

-   Description: This middleware function is designed to append additional response functionality to each request. It utilizes the `response` middleware to process incoming requests and manipulate the response object accordingly before passing control to the next middleware.
-   Parameters:
    -   `req`: Represents the incoming HTTP request. This parameter can be any type, allowing flexibility in handling various types of requests.
    -   `res`: Represents the outgoing HTTP response. As with `req`, this can be any type, catering to diverse response manipulations.
    -   `next`: A callback function that, when called, passes control to the next middleware function in the stack.
-   Operation: Initially, it calls the imported `response` middleware with the current `req`, `res`, and `next` parameters. After the `response` middleware finishes executing (noted by `await`), it calls `next()` to continue the Express middleware chain.

### Middleware Setup:

1.  JSON Request Body Parsing: The application is configured to parse JSON bodies of incoming requests, which is standard for API servers to properly receive and understand JSON data.

    javascriptCopy code

    `app.use(express.json());`

2.  URL Encoded Request Body Parsing: It also parses URL-encoded bodies, allowing the server to accept data from forms sent as HTTP POST requests.

    javascriptCopy code

    `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`

3.  Using `responseAppender` Middleware: The `responseAppender` function is applied to all routes, ensuring that the response appending functionality is executed for each request.

    javascriptCopy code

    `app.use(responseAppender);`

4.  Handling Unknown API Requests: Any requests that do not match known routes are handled by this middleware, which creates and passes a 404 error to the error-handling middleware.

    javascriptCopy code

    `app.use((req, res, next) => {
      next(Error("Not found"));
    });`

### Export:

-   The configured Express application object `app` is exported, allowing it to be used by other parts of the application or started by the server.

These functions and middleware setup are crucial for setting up the server's request processing pipeline, ensuring that it handles different types of input correctly and extends response functionalities as necessary.

# index.ts

Here's the detailed documentation for each function and significant line in the file located at [`src/index.ts`](https://github.com/ferrumnet/multiswap-validator-node/blob/main/src/index.ts) from the `ferrumnet/multiswap-validator-node` GitHub repository:

typescriptCopy code

`// Importing required modules and components

import dotenv from "dotenv";

import app from "./app";

import awsSecretsManager from "./utils/awsSecretsManager";

import transactionsJob from "./crons/transactionsJob";

// Load environment variables from .env file into process.env

dotenv.config();

// Main asynchronous function to initialize necessary components and start jobs

(async () => {

  // Initialize AWS secrets manager to securely handle secrets

  await awsSecretsManager();

  // Start the transactions job to handle transaction-related tasks

  transactionsJob();

})().catch((e) => {

  // Log any errors that occur during the initialization or during runtime

  console.log(e);

});

// Starts the server listening on the port specified in the environment variables

const server = app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {

  // Log that the server is listening and on which port

  console.info(`Listening to port ${process.env.PORT}`);

});`

### File Overview:

This TypeScript file is the main entry point for a Node.js application that utilizes environmental variables, initializes AWS secrets management, runs a transactions job, and starts an HTTP server. Here's a breakdown of the components:

-   dotenv: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

-   app: Represents the Express application imported from `./app`.

-   awsSecretsManager: A utility function to initialize the AWS Secrets Manager for handling secret configurations.

-   transactionsJob: A cron job function from `./crons/transactionsJob` that handles transaction-related operations.

-   server: An instance of the server that listens on the port defined in the environment variables and logs the listening event.

This file encapsulates initializing essential services and components, catching any errors during their setup, and starting a server to listen for requests.
